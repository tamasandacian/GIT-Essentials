To delete feature branches:
	- requires to be switched to a different branch 

git branch -d feature_branch_1						: with -d informes for deleting feature_branch_1
													  (does not delete feature_branch_1)

git push origin :feature_branch_1
git push --delete origin feature_branch_1
git push -d origin feature_branch_1

git checkout -b delete_test							: creates & switches to delete_test branch
git branch 											: checks in which branch you're currently in					
	*delete_test
	master

git push -u origin delete_test						: track the new feature branch on remote
git branch -r 										: shows all branches from remote
	origin/master
	origin/delete_test

git branch 											: checks in which branch you're currently in					
	*delete_test
	master


git branch -d delete_test
!!! Error: Cannot delete branch 'delete_test' checked out at ...

git commit -am "Change file for testing"			: change & commit file 
git merge master

git branch --merged									: check all merged branches
	*master

git checkout master

git branch -d delete_test
